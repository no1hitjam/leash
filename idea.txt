alpha-dimension
  stars are attracted to you
  stars leaving through black hole enter beta dimension as stars

beta-dimension 
  stars are repelled by you
  stars leaving through black hole enter alpha dimension as consumables

both dimensions
  enough stars combine to create a black hole to the other dimension
  stars are attracted to black holes made in same dimension
  stars are repelled by black holes made in other dimension



needs:
  better background and black hole graphics
  consumables



  fixing black holes:
  make it really harsh when you're moving in a similar direction
  a lot less harsh when you're perpendicular (right now it's harsh)
  ditto when you're moving away (works correctly now)
