alpha-dimension
  stars are attracted to you
  stars leaving through black hole enter beta dimension as stars

beta-dimension 
  stars are repelled by you
  stars leaving through black hole enter alpha dimension as consumables

both dimensions
  enough stars combine to create a black hole to the other dimension
  stars are attracted to black holes made in same dimension
  stars are repelled by black holes made in other dimension



needs:
  black holes forming close together buggy?
  fullscreen
  executable
  cocoonjs iphone game with tilt controls?
  tips and tricks (unlockables?)
  results page
  lore
  other modes?
  stop squaring for black hole suction? (too disorienting?)
  zoom appropriately per resolution



fixing black holes:
make it really harsh when you're moving in a similar direction
a lot less harsh when you're perpendicular (right now it's harsh)
ditto when you're moving away (works correctly now)



todo: 
* spawn some pellets at the start
* visual instructions for stars and pellets
* make small stars have less "friction" than large ones
